# Usage:
#
#     $ wait_for_docker_container.sh <containerId> <logMessage>
#
# Example:
#
#     $ wait_for_docker_container.sh selenium "Started Selenium Standalone"
#
# This script will wait a maximum of 30 seconds for a given message to appear in
# the logs of a given running Docker container.
# Its purpose is to prevent CI jobs to fail because a container didnâ€™t have time
# to start its services properly, and to help debug the CI jobs by providing
# the last 10 lines from the logs of each container.
#
